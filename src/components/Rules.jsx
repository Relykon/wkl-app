      <h1> Rules. Learn'em! </h1>
      <p> 1. No hitting people in the head...like hard.  If a player is sliding/dodging/head ends up where you wouldn't normally expect a head to be, you should do your best to avoid the head, but a head shot will still be an out. </p>
      <p> 2. No <i>"methamphetamine"</i> pitching. The pitcher's job is to roll the ball over the plate, <b>breezy like a unicorn.</b> </p>
      <p> 3. At the plate, <i><b>three</b> foul balls and you're out.</i> There are no "balls" and "strikes". If a player crosses the line to kick, the ball is foul and can be caught for an out. </p>
      <p> 4. No stealing and no lead-offs. You can tag up <i>after</i> a ball is caught in <u>fair territory</u>. If the ball is caught in foul territory, you cannot advance. </p>
      <p> 5. Respect the No-Go Zone. Catchers need to touch the backstop until the kicker makes contact. The play is dead once the pitcher has the ball at/near the mound. </p>
      <p> 6. No sincere crying, unless you're passing a kidney stone. </p>
      <p> 7. The Umpires and Commishes are the Alphas and the Omegas, dude or dudette. </p>
      <p> 8. FACE KONTROL! Your team needs a uniform, and every member should wear it. "Uniform" can be interpreted how you like, but it should be visible. Matching thongs are nice, but we need to see them. </p>
      <p> 9. Batting list + field list = a game where another team won't bitch at you for only playing your 2 meatiest biggest dudes. ROTATE all your players or die </p>
      <p> 10. 6 members of your team need to show up to play, otherwise you forfeit a game. Even that is not really enough, spiritually. Three women on the field at all times. </p>
      <p> 11. The team with the best taunt wins home field advantage. <b>If there’s no taunt</b> the penalty is an extra out in the 2nd and 4th inning and <u><i>a taunt forfeit disqualifies a team from the taunt championship.</i></u> </p>
      <p> 12. If the catcher takes <b>possession</b> of a kicked ball, <i>*not just touching it*</i>,  before it leaves the no-go zone, then that kick is a foul. </p>
      <p> 13. <u><b>Pack out all recycling and excessive trash.</b> Let’s keep our field and neighborhood image clean and awesome!!!</u> </p>
