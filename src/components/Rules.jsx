1. No hitting people in the head, like hard.  If a player is sliding/dodging/head ends up where you wouldn't normally expect a head to be, you should do your best to avoid the head, but a head shot will still be an out.

2. No "methamphetamine" pitching. The pitcher's job is to roll the ball over the plate, breezy like a unicorn.

3. At the plate, four foul balls and you're out. There are no "balls" and "strikes". If a player crosses the line to kick, the ball is foul and can be caught for an out.

4. No stealing and no lead-offs. You can tag up after a ball is caught in fair territory. If the ball is caught in foul territory, you cannot advance.

5. Respect the No-Go Zone. Catchers need to touch the backstop until the kicker makes contact. The play is dead once the pitcher has the ball at/near the mound.

6. No sincere crying, unless you're passing a kidney stone.

7. The Umpires and Commishes are the Alphas and the Omegas, dude or dudette.

8. FACE KONTROL! Your team needs a uniform, and every member should wear it. "Uniform" can be interpreted how you like, but it should be visible. Matching thongs are nice, but we need to see them.

9. Batting list + field list = a game where another team won't bitch at you for only playing your 2 meatiest biggest dudes. ROTATE all your players or die

10. 6 members of your team need to show up to play, otherwise you forfeit a game. Even that is not really enough, spiritually. Three women on the field at all times.

11. The team with the best taunt wins home field advantage. If there’s no taunt, the penalty is an extra out in the 2nd and 4th inning and a taunt forfeit disqualifies a team from the taunt championship.

12. If the catcher takes possession of a kicked ball, *not just touching it*,  before it leaves the no-go zone, then that kick is a foul.

13. Pack out all recycling and excessive trash. Let’s keep our field and neighborhood image clean and awesome!
